    Base class for packaging your code.

    The packager is generally used as part of an Executor
    and provides the executor with information on how to package your code.

    It can also include information on how to run your code.
    For example, a packager can determine whether to use torchrun
    or whether to use debug flags.

    .. note::
        This class can also be used independently as a passthrough packager.
        This is useful in cases where you do not need to package code.
        For example, a local executor which uses your current working directory
        or an executor that uses a docker image that has all the code included.
