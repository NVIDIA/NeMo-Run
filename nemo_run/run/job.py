class Job(ConfigurableMixin):
    """
    A Job represents a single task within an Experiment, combining a task definition with its execution environment.

    This class is primarily used internally by the Experiment class and is not typically instantiated directly by users.
    It encapsulates all the information needed to run a single task, including the task itself, the executor
    configuration, and metadata about the job's state and execution.

    Attributes:
        id (str): A unique identifier for the job within the experiment.
        task (Union[Partial, Script]): The task to be executed, either as a Partial (configured function) or a Script.
        executor (Executor): The executor configuration for running the task.
        handle (str): A unique identifier for the running job, set when the job is launched.
        launched (bool): Indicates whether the job has been launched.
        state (AppState): The current state of the job (e.g., UNSUBMITTED, RUNNING, SUCCEEDED, FAILED).
        plugins (Optional[list[ExperimentPlugin]]): Any plugins to be applied to this job.
        tail_logs (bool): Whether to tail the logs of this job during execution.

    The Job class is responsible for:
    - Serializing and deserializing job configurations
    - Launching the task on the specified executor
    - Monitoring the job's status
    - Retrieving logs
    - Cancelling the job if necessary
    - Cleaning up resources after job completion

    While users typically interact with jobs through the Experiment interface, understanding the Job class
    can be helpful for advanced usage scenarios or when developing custom plugins or executors.

    A JobGroup represents a collection of related tasks within an Experiment that are managed together.

    This class is primarily used internally by the Experiment class and is not typically instantiated directly by users.
    It allows for the grouping of multiple tasks that share common characteristics or need to be executed
    in a coordinated manner, such as tasks that should run on the same node or share resources.

    Attributes:
        id (str): A unique identifier for the job group within the experiment.
        tasks (list[Union[Partial, Script]]): A list of tasks to be executed in this group.
        executors (Union[Executor, list[Executor]]): The executor(s) for running the tasks. Can be a single
                                                     executor shared by all tasks or a list of executors.
        handles (list[str]): Unique identifiers for the running jobs, set when the jobs are launched.
        launched (bool): Indicates whether the job group has been launched.
        states (list[AppState]): The current states of the jobs in the group.

    The JobGroup class is responsible for:
    - Managing the execution of multiple related tasks
    - Handling task dependencies within the group
    - Serializing and deserializing job group configurations
    - Launching tasks on specified executors
    - Monitoring the status of all tasks in the group
    - Retrieving logs for the entire group
    - Cancelling all jobs in the group if necessary
    - Cleaning up resources after all jobs in the group have completed

    JobGroups are particularly useful for:
    - Executing multiple tasks that need to share resources or run on the same node
    - Managing sets of tasks with internal dependencies
    - Optimizing resource allocation for related tasks

    While users typically interact with job groups through the Experiment interface, understanding the JobGroup class
    can be helpful for designing complex workflows or when developing custom plugins or executors that need to
    handle groups of related tasks.
