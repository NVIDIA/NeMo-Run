    "### 1. Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in using NeMo Run is to configure your python function. As mentioned above, we're trying to configure the `add` function. Configuration is similar to python's native [functools.partial](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial). In fact, for most functions you can replace `functools.partial` with `run.Partial` and it should still work. Configuration just ties your function and your arguments together to create an `run.Partial` object which can be shipped around to executed at a later time. This is done by building the `run.Partial` object which will recursively build any configured objects and then return a [`functools.partial` object](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#partial-objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to our first building blocks of NeMo Run - `Partial` and `Config`. These are buildables that allow you to configure functions, arguments and objects in a pythonic way. Under the hood, we use [fiddle](https://fiddle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage the configuration. In fact, our `Partial` and `Config` subclass `fiddle.Partial` and `fiddle.Config` respectively, with some addons that help with the UX and programmability of your configuration. We take some inspiration from [Praxis](https://github.com/google/praxis/blob/main/praxis/pax_fiddle.py#L72) but also have custom addons that we believe should improve the user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already discussed `run.Partial`. `run.Config` is similar in the sense that it takes a `fn` or `class` as the first argument and the `fn` or `class` `*args` and `**kwargs` as the subsequent arguments. However, on building `run.Config` it actually calls the underlying `fn` or in case of a `class` its `__init__` method with the arguments tied into the `Config`. So for example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import fiddle as fdl\n",
    "import nemo_run as run\n",
    "def hello_world(msg: str):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello World! {msg}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "cfg = run.Config(hello_world, msg=\"How are you?\")\n",
    "partial = run.Partial(hello_world, msg=\"How are you?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "fn = fdl.build(partial)\n",
    "fn()\n",
    "#>>> Hello World! How are you?\n",
    "\n",
    "built_cfg = fdl.build(cfg)\n",
    "#>>> Hello World! How are you?\n",
    "\n",
    "print(built_cfg is None)\n",
    "#>>> True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Partial` and `Config` classes also come with utilities that provide a visual representation of the object (if you have `graphviz` installed). Try running the cell below to configure the `add` function and visualize the configured `Partial`."

    "The configured function is now ready for execution. But before we go into execution, let's look at configuring complex functions that take in non-primitive types. Along with it, we will also look at another utility that NeMo Run provides - `run.autoconvert`. `run.autoconvert` is a decorator that allows you to automatically convert functions returning regular Python objects to functions that return a `run.Config` of the underlying object. To demonstrate this, let's consider an `add_object` function that looks like \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class SomeObject:\n",
    "    value_1: int\n",
    "    value_2: int\n",
    "    value_3: int\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def add_object(obj_1: SomeObject, obj_2: SomeObject) -> SomeObject:\n",
    "    result = SomeObject(\n",
    "        value_1=obj_1.value_1 + obj_2.value_1,\n",
    "        value_2=obj_1.value_2 + obj_2.value_2,\n",
    "        value_3=obj_1.value_3 + obj_2.value_3,\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    print(f\"{result = }\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To configure this function, you can use `run.Partial`. Note however that you will need to ensure that the arguments to the function are `run.Config` or `run.Partial` instances as well. This is necessary for serialization and remote execution, but more on that later. For now, a basic configuration for `add_object` looks like\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "run.Partial(\n",
    "    add_object,\n",
    "    obj_1=run.Config(SomeObject, value_1=10, value_2=20, value_3=30),\n",
    "    obj_2=run.Config(SomeObject, value_1=10, value_2=20, value_3=30),\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say you have a regular python function that returns `SomeObject` and you want to use it as one of the arguments to `add_object`. You can decorate it using `run.autoconvert` as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@run.autoconvert\n",
    "def commonly_used_object() -> SomeObject:\n",
    "    return SomeObject(\n",
    "        value_1=5,\n",
    "        value_2=10,\n",
    "        value_3=15,\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `run.autoconvert` decorator uses fiddle's autoconfig and parses the AST so that you get the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "commonly_used_object() == run.Config(SomeObject, value_1=5, value_2=10, value_3=15)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then use the decorated function as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "run.Partial(\n",
    "    add_object,\n",
    "    obj_1=run.Config(SomeObject, value_1=10, value_2=20, value_3=30),\n",
    "    obj_2=commonly_used_object(),\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you can also use args in the function. Note however that `run.autoconvert` currently doesn't support control flow and may be unreliable for complex code. In that case, you can define a function to return the `run.Config` directly, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def commonly_used_config() -> run.Config[SomeObject]:\n",
    "    config = run.Config(\n",
    "        SomeObject,\n",
    "        value_1=5,\n",
    "        value_2=10,\n",
    "        value_3=15,\n",
    "    )\n",
    "\n",
    "    for i in range(10):\n",
    "        config.value_1 *= i\n",
    "        config.value_2 += i\n",
    "        config.value_3 -= i\n",
    "\n",
    "    return config\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📝 `autoconvert` returns a `run.Config` of the underlying object by default whereas `@autoconvert(partial=True)` returns a `run.Partial` of the underlying object\n",
    "\n",
    "One additional thing is that the arguments of a `run.Partial` or `run.Config` can be mutated via dot access, as shown below:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fn.obj_1.value_1 = 100\n",
    "fn.obj_2.value_2 *= 2\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",

During packaging, we currently use `git archive` for our remote slurm executor and you can specify a subpath which will be set as the working directory for the execution. So for example, to execute `add_object` function, you will provide a subpath of `examples/hello-world` assuming `examples` is at the root of the repository. This will ensure that during remote execution, imports of the style `from simple.add import add_object` work properly.

Once we have an instance of `run.LocalExecutor`, we can pass it to `run.run` to execute the same configured function on the local executor, which will run the function in a separate process. This is the ease of use provided by NeMo Run. You can configure a function once, and execute it on any supported remote cluster seamlessly. Later, we will also explore `run.Experiment` which allows you to combine and manage multiple runs; giving additional flexibility to the user.\n",
