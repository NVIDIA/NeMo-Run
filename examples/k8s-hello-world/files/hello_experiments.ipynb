    "# Hello NeMo-Run Experiments!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second part of our hello world tutorial series for NeMo-Run. Please make sure that you have gone through the [first part](hello_world.ipynb) beforehand, since this tutorial builds heavily on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key component of NeMo-Run is `run.Experiment`. For an introduction to `run.Experiment`, refer to its docstring, which is also posted below:\n",
    "\n",
    "`run.Experiment` is a context manager to launch and manage multiple runs using pure Python. It offers researchers with a simple and flexible way to create and manage their ML experiments. Building on the core components of NeMo-Run, `run.Experiment` can be used as an umbrella under which users can launch different configured functions across multiple remote clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `run.Experiment` context manager takes care of storing the run metadata, launching it on the specified cluster, and syncing the logs and artifacts. Additionally, `run.Experiment` also provides management tools to easily inspect and reproduce past experiments.\n",
    "Some of the use cases that it enables are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check the status and logs of a past experiment.\n",
    "2. Reproduce a past experiment and rerun it.\n",
    "3. Reconstruct a past experiment and relaunch it after some changes.\n",
    "4. Compare different runs of the same experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This API allows users to programmatically define their experiments entirely in Python. To illustrate the flexibility it provides, here are some use cases that can be supported by `run.Experiment` with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Launch a benchmarking run on different GPUs at the same time in parallel.\n",
    "2. Launch a sequential data processing pipeline on a CPU heavy cluster.\n",
    "3. Launch hyperparameter grid search runs on a single cluster in parallel.\n",
    "4. Launch hyperparameter search runs distributed across all available clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The docstring also includes some code examples. In this tutorial, we build on `add_object` from the previous tutorial to define a simple experiment and show its capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get into it.\n"

    "Now, let's say we want to run these two configured functions together and manage them under an experiment. We can do so with just a few lines of code shown below. Try running it: it will launch the two tasks sequentially and wait for them to complete.\n",

    "\n",
